# Deployments

Kubernetes doesnâ€™t let us run containers by themselves. They must be wrapped in a pod first.

- Service mesh
- Sidecar
- Donâ€™t allow Scaling.

# Architecture

Deployments wrap pods

- One deployment manage one type of pod
    - Canâ€™t have an app and DB in same deployment
    - Would have to make two deployments

Replica-set is an intermediary that actually handles mechanics of the scaling and replication of pods within a deployment

## Strategy and Updating a Cluster

```yaml
replicas: 10000
strategy:
	rollingUpdate:
		maxSurge: 1 # How many extra "instances" allocated during provisioning
		maxUnavailable: 0 # Number you can go below desired state (replicas)
	type: RollingUpdate
```

Zero downtime operation, if clients can handle it. 

Replica Set helps you through it ðŸ™‚. We can manipulate them if we *really* want to. Doesnâ€™t mean we should.

## Labels

Labels tell the Deployment which Pods to select.

- The Deployment will manage all pods with a particular label, whether the Replica Set creates them or whether you manually add them to the cluster

## Extra Notes

- If you manually add a labeled pod to a cluster with 3 replicas, it will just terminate the new one to maintain the desired state
- Changing any values in template for pods will trigger an update
    - Upping replica count will only add new pods, none of old ones will be replaced (no Rolling Update)
- If you post an update while the cluster is already in the building process, the newer version will supersede (current update will be dropped and overridden)

# Demo

## Deployment

```yaml
# deployment.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    run: test
  name: test
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: test
  minReadySeconds: 5
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1 # Can use percentage
      maxUnavailable: 0
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: test
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.12
        name: nginx
```

### Notable Commands

```bash
# Just push updated file:
kubectl apply -f $(FILE)
# --record flag

# Describe replica set
kubectl describe rs
kubectl get rs (-o wide)

# Check rolling update
kubectl rollout status deploy $(NAME)

# Check history
kubectl rollout history deploy test
kubectl rollout history deploy test --revision=3

# Undo (imperative operation)
kubectl rollout undo deploy test
```

Undoing imperatively via undo is not recommended, as it will create a mismatch between the YAML file (explicit, declarative) and the deployed deployments 

- Best option is to change YAML file and reapply it

## Deployment Example #2

```yaml
# deploy.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    run: prod-redis
  name: prod-redis
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: prod-redis
  replicas: 3
  minReadySeconds: 300
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: prod-redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: redis:4.0
        name: redis
```
